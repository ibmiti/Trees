# Trees - Datastructure

Q: What is the Tree Datastructure?
A: A widely used abstract data-type, it simulates a hierchy
  - a hierarchical tree structure where the very top is the parent node
    and the branching node are its child , or child nodes, I view the parent node as the tree above ground-level ; whilst the child nodes are spawning beneath like roots

Q: Where do we see the example of this Tree Datastructure?:
A:

Q: are there any operations we can perform upon Trees?:
A:

Q: What are there Run-times of each?
A:

Q: What other data-structure is it similar to?:
A:

Q: What is an AST?:
A: 

Q: WHat differentiates Trees from arrays and linked-list?:
A: while they both can store data, arrays,and linkedlist do so in a linear fashion,
   while a tree stores things by heiracrchy e.g ; directory structure, coroporate structure - are both examples of hierarchical data
